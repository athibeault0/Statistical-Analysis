Part 5: Thought Question\n","\n","> *Comparing concat vs merge in Pandas, are there any downsides to choosing one method over the other? Use [Pandas: Merge, join, concatenate and compare](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging) as a reference.*"],"metadata":{"id":"h8qwMvHZNcCP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["It seems like there are benefits and downsides to both approaches based on the purpose of joining data frames. For example, one of the big differences between concatenate and merge is the place of attachment. The concat method attaches two data frames either along the rows or columns (based on the axis value) which is somewhat limiting if you wanted to make further modifications. Merge, on the other hand, allows you to choose a connecting point for the two data frames using a condition (with the \"on\" and \"how\" details) to preserve data types. However, with concat, we can also work with joining a data frame and a series (variable/ column) instead of two data frame sets. Both methods have a similar method of how to deal with indices when the two dataframes have different indices. Join for concat and how for merge both operate similarly, though how has more options (outer/ inner versus outer/ inner/ left/ right). I think if you are looking to be more specific with the way you want to attach two data frames, merge offers more specifications, but if you are simply looking to attach one data set to the bottom of the other, concat is perfectly adequate. I think it just comes down to how particular you need to be in order to determine which pandas method you would use to afix data frames."],"metadata":{"id":"8uBEbpXONhqm"}}]}
